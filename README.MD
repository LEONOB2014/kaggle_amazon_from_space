## Descripton
This is my code from competition Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space. My solution based on State of the art imagenet1k models like ResneXt and DPN.


## Used packages
* mxnet 0.7.0 for DPNs
* mxnet 0.8.0 for ResNeXts
* pytorch for iterator

## Run
Sorry, this code can't run out of the box. But it might be interesting for training logs and as an example of using pytorch iterator with mxnet.
## Net
Here is nets I used:
* [DPNs](https://github.com/cypw/DPNs)
* [ResNeXts](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/master/example/image-classification)
* [ResNet-50 imagnet11k+place365-ch](http://data.mxnet.io/models/imagenet-11k-place365-ch/)

## Train log
I put all log in [logs](https://github.com/N01Z3/kaggle_amazon_from_space/tree/master/logs)
